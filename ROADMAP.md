# Currently not planned unless requested during project discussions:
1. Publish Verified Integration with a CephFS Cluster via Rook.io  
   Provide an alternative to the current high-availability NFS setup using Rook.io (Ceph), which offers greater scalability, resilience, and automated storage management.

2. Implement a Split-Brain Resolution Mechanism  
   Mitigate potential split-brain conditions in the existing high-availability architecture by incorporating appropriate quorum or conflict resolution strategies.

3. Finish implementation of building latest CoreOS images using administrator node.
